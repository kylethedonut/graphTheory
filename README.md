# graphTheory
Collection of graph theory programming projects I'm making over the 2023 summer

# project 1: Degree Sequence Graphicality 5/10/23
this uses a theorem in graph theory there you can determine
if a graph is graphical by removing the highest degree
vertex and seeing if the remaining graph is graphical
also i made this one on my birthday :)

# project 2: graph pebbling game
